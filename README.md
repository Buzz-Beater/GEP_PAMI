# GEP

This repo is adapted from the [original GEP repo](https://github.com/SiyuanQi/generalized-earley-parser) and contains code and adjustments for our TPAMI 2020 paper.

# Dependencies

Please check that all required packages from ```requirements.txt``` are properly installed.


# Experiments

This repo contains code for reproducing the results reported in our TPAMI paper.

To run your experments properly, please download the datasets and adjust the paths information properly in ```config.py```.

We provide three example scripts for showing how to use this code for the purpose of activity parsing and also future prediction.

First, we show how to run experiments for activity parsing in ```breakfast_det.sh``` and ```gep_breakfast_det.sh```. These two shell scripts run ```baseline``` and ```gep``` for recognizing human actions respectively. As the breakfast dataset is big in frame number, we tried subsampling frames as one hyper-parameter which could be tuned during experiment. Please change the ```LOG_PATH``` to your correct logging path for storing the results before running the scripts.

Next, for activity prediction, we use prediction on CAD dataset as an example. As shown in ```cad_pred.sh```, we run baseline training/eval and also gep prediction. We report and store models' performance under different prediction duration, which could be set in the shell script. Please also change the ```LOG_PATH``` to your correct loggging path for storing the results.

# Data
For features used for reproducing experimental results, please find at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVQtmidrjhnn4bqq-xeZ55_qfTUG6Nun/view?usp=sharing). Please put the unzipped directory at a correct location and fix the path needed to these features inside ```config.py``` to match the correct location for features path used in ```datasets/{dataset}.py```.
